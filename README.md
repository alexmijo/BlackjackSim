# BlackjackSim
A text based blackjack simulator for one player in C++

I made this at the very beggining of my internship at Microsystems. This is a better example of good quality C++ code that I've written than the Population Circles repository is, since the Population Circles code was just something I whipped together in my freetime (even though it's much larger) and I wasn't really caring if it ended up being kinda spaghetti-code like or had a couple minor bugs (normally I do care about that stuff lol).
